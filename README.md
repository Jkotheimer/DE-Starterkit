# DE-Starterkit

A set of environment configuration files and helper scripts that I find help my development process.

I find myself re-installing my operating system more often than I ever thought I would. Having to copy over environment config files and helper scripts is annoying. Now I can just clone this repo and run `./setup.sh`. Problem solved.
